				When western kochi was blind folded in the field of education, when the students of this
area had no hope for their future, A lime light arose at FortKochi in the year of 1991 with
the name "Pratheeksha".
			</div>
    	
<br />

'Pratheeksha' was just a humble attempt by a few young men who had a good heart and
soul, who were unselfish in their acts. It was this unselfishness that God almighty saw in
their heart and the creator bestowed his grace. Since then "Pratheeksha" never had to look
back.


    </div>
    <div class="para">
    	The first centre was started at Da'wathul Islam Trust, Thuruthi(Fortkochi). After two years a branch was opened at I.D.A.
Building Kochangadi. Next year another branch started at A.M.I. Building, Thangala Nagar (Palluruthy).After five years
the Headquarters was moved to Seelat building, NewRoad(Mattancherry).There after, started a new branch at N.I.M
Building,Nellukadave(Fortkochi).At the 10th year started a 5th branch at I.C.A Building,kacherypady(Palluruthy). Every
year thousands of pupils from 5th to Higher secondary classes exploring the service from Pratheeksha Teaching Centre


    </div>
    <div class="para">
    	By the grace of Allah almighty all these centres has taught thousands of students and paved way for their better future. The
staff of 'Pratheeksha' is unlike any other private educational institutions. When they teach their pupils, their heart consider it
as an act of worship to the one and only. That spiritual touch made their service unmatched to any other acts of men. We
pray with bowed heads to take us to heights and leaps then ever before.
